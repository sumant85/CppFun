namespace sh {
// This class wraps around a target that would be called when the guard exits scope.
// Typical use is to perform cleanup as some function exits scope.
// Example :
// void foo(Database& db) {
//     auto conn = db.open();
//     Guard g([&]{ conn.close() });
//     // do stuff with conn
// }
// This class has a noexcept(false) destructor, which means that we allow throwing
// as a part of the guard cleanup phase.
// Instantiating this within a function body with compiler optimizations enabled leads
// to the same code as manually writing try/catch. Thus, we don't have to worry about
// generation of additional typeinfo/vtables which cause code bloat.
// Meant for scope-based cleanup
